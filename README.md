# FIRESim
Financial Independence/ Retire Early Simulator

This is a simple simulator that uses numpy's normal distribution functions to 
estimate possible outcomes in a retirement scenario.  You can set up estimated
stock and bond returns, inflation values, and the standard deviation of each to 
model the marketplace.  You can also set a starting portfolio value, yearly
spend amount, and time horizon.

The simuation will run any number of times using a normal 
distribution to estimate the success rate of the given scenario, and plot
some results and run some statistics.
